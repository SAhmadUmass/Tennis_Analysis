In this project, I used YoloV5 for object detection and tracking, identifying players and drawing bounding boxes around them. I also fine-tuned 
YoloV5 a Tennis Ball dataset to identify and track tennis balls. Further, I used linear regression to predict where the tennis ball would move 
in the next frames.
